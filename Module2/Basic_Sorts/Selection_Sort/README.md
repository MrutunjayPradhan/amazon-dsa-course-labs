## 🧩 Challenge Description

Ashley, a teacher, wants to **rank student test scores from highest to lowest**. Your task is to help her by implementing the **Selection Sort algorithm** to sort an array of test scores in **descending order**.

---

## 📊 Input Data

```java
int[] testScores = {85, 92, 78, 96, 89, 73, 91};

🎯 Objective
Sort the array using Selection Sort in descending order and print:
Test scores sorted in descending order: 96 92 91 89 85 78 73

---

✅ Implementation Highlights
Traverse the array and find the maximum value in the unsorted segment.

Swap it with the first unsorted index.

Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

---

📌 Sample Output

Test scores sorted in descending order: 96 92 91 89 85 78 73

---

💡 Key Concepts
🔁 Selection Sort: Efficient for small datasets; selects the max/min each pass.

🧠 Descending Order: Only change is arr[maxIndex] < arr[check] in the comparison.

⚙️ Clean Swapping: Performed only if maxIndex != sortedIndex.

🧠 Learnings
Reinforced sorting logic using Selection Sort.

Practiced descending order logic with comparisons and swaps.

Applied real-world problem solving for ranking systems.
