# ðŸ§ª Lab 2 â€“ TreeMap Enhanced Waiting List

This lab builds on the previous HashMap-based registration waiting list application and enhances it using `TreeMap` to introduce natural key ordering and navigational methods.

---

## âœ… Objectives

- Use `TreeMap` to store students by their last names (as keys).
- Implement efficient methods to find:
  - The first student alphabetically
  - The last student alphabetically
  - The next student after a given last name
  - The previous student before a given last name

---

## ðŸ“š Concepts Practiced

- TreeMap key sorting
- Navigating TreeMap using:
  - `firstEntry()`
  - `lastEntry()`
  - `higherEntry(key)`
  - `lowerEntry(key)`
- Clean object-oriented design (`ListManager`, `Student`, `WaitingList`)
- Graceful handling of edge cases and null values
